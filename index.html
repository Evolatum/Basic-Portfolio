                An animator by trade, I specialize in motion graphics for publicity, doing mostly freelance work in the industry, sometimes working in tandem with my wife Ariana.

            <p>
                I've found myself branching into new areas of interest, one being web design and a full-stack developer, whilst studying a master's degree in existential psychotherapy.
                <br>
                I thoroughly enjoy trying new things and take myself as a quick learner (although many times I forget things just as fast). My personal interests are animation, board games, and tabletop games.
