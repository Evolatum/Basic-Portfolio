            <p>
                An animator by trade, I specialize in motion graphics for publicity, doing mostly freelance work in the industry, sometimes working in tandem with my wife Ariana (who would probably comment that <i>I</i> work in tandem with <i>her</i>).
            </p>

            <p>
                I've worked in a wide variety of jobs, making animated sports content for a mexican television network, teaching and aiding seniors with cognitive and computer skills, and creating ads for political campigns (with which I do not necessarily agree);
                I like to think of myself and my work as versatile.
                I've found myself branching into new areas of interest, one being web design and  full-stack development, whilst also studying a master's degree in existential-fenemenologic psychotherapy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I thoroughly enjoy trying new things and take myself as a quick learner (although many times I forget things just as fast). My personal interests are animation (any kind, even the ones I quite fear working on myself), board games (most kinds, even the ones I fear playing), and tabletop games (all kinds, even more if I can cause fear in my players). 
                I love world-building, and am very proud of the universe I've created for game-mastering purposes, and try my luck with writing now and then.
