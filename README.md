# Portfolio

The app has a landing page that displays information about me and the stack I use (MERN), links to CV in both english and spanish, and a brief explanation of responsive web design.

The projects page contains highlited projects, each with an image, page link, GitHub link, and brief description of what it is, what I did, and the technologies used.

The contact page allows users to send emails directly to me (without needing to log in) and contains links to both my GitHub and LinkedIn pages.
